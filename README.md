turtle web server
======

turtle is a libevent based http server which supports php files via php-fpm.

> "Look at that turtle go bro!"

I got bored on a Saturday and wanted to see if I could do this or not.

- Needs config implementation
- Needs vhost stuffs
- Needs direct php-fpm passthrough implementation

##Library requirements and cgi binary
- apt-get install libevent-2.0-5 libevent-core-2.0-5
- apt-get install libevent-extra-2.0-5
- apt-get install libevent-dev
- apt-get install libfcgi0ldbl


I wouldn't use this if I were you, I don't know how to program.
But if someone wants to see how it is done roughly then take a look.
